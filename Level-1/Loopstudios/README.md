## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

# Frontend Mentor - Loopstudios landing page

![Design preview for the Loopstudios landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML and CSS and a basic understanding of JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
